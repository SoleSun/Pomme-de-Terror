# Pomme-de-Terror

Arduino code for line-following robot "Pomme-de-Terror." It won first place in our summer competition!
Here's a video of us in the finals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epd6TsiDIt8

In six weeks, for ENPH 253, my team of four built an autonomous robot that was able to:
 * navigate a narrow course, indicated by black electrical tape
 * differentiate infrared signal frequencies to determine when to pass through a gate
 * rescue toys from platforms above a pool of water
 * transport them to safety by using a zipline
